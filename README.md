# MNIST from Scratch

This is an academic exercise to create all facets of a multilayer perceptron from scratch. Here scratch means just using Python and NumPy. This model will be trained and benchmarked on both the classical [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) and [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) data sets.

This work closely follows the [Introduction to Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) textbook by Michael Nielsen, but uses no code from the textbook.
