# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repo consists of academic exercises to create all facets of the following neural network architectures from scratch.
- A multilayer perceptron, including
    - Regularization
    - Dropout
- A convolutional neural network

Here scratch means just using Python and NumPy. 

Implementations will be benchmarked on both the classical [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) and [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) data sets.

## Accuracy Achieved
TODO

## Resources
- [Introduction to Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen

## Project TODOs
