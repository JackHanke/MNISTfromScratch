# MNISTfromScratch

This is an academic exercise to create all facets of a multilayer perceptron from scratch. Here scratch means just using Python and NumPy. This model will be trained on the classical [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) data set to benchmark it's accuracy and speed.

Most information will be collected from the University of Toronto's [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://sgfin.github.io/files/notes/CS321_Grosse_Lecture_Notes.pdf) course, lead by Professor Roger Grosse. 

I will also be following the homework for this course (found [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc321_2017/)). The assignments that involve coding will be published under the `homework` directory.
